In addition to giving an answer, also return a score of how fully it answered the user's question. This should be in the following format:

Question: [question here]
Helpful Answer: [answer here]
Score: [score between 0 and 100]

How to determine the score:
- Higher is a better answer
- Better responds fully to the asked question, with lots of detail
- If you do not know the answer based on the context, that should be a score of 0
- Don't be overconfident!
